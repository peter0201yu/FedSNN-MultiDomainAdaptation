# Multi-Domain Adaptation in a Federated Learning scenario with Spiking Neural Networks

## Acknowledgement
The federated learning framework and SNN implementation are based on this research: [Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks](https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Yale/FedSNN)
The multi-domain adaptation method is based on this research: [SFDA - Domain Adaptation without Source Data](https://github.com/youngryan1993/SFDA-SourceFreeDA)

## Run Experiment
Run `test_fed_mda.sh` as an example test script. Argument choices are explained in `./utils/options.py`.

## Results
Will be updated.
